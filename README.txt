Materials & Audio - Haunted House

Description:

	A haunted house environment consisting of two floor sections and an 
	outside section. Each section has its own background music controlled via
	triggers. Public domain textures from the internet were used and 
	normal maps were generated using GIMP/Photoshop filters; the skybox is
	a standard unity asset.
